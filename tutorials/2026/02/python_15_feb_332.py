# This script teaches Merge Sort algorithm implementation.
# Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits a list of elements into two halves, 
# recursively sorts them and then merges them back together in sorted order.

def merge_sort(arr):
    # Base case: If the array has only one element or is empty, it's already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Find the middle index of the array to split it into two halves
    mid = len(arr) // 2

    # Recursively sort the left and right halves
    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])

    # Merge the sorted left and right halves
    return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the merged result
    merged = []
    
    # While both lists have elements, compare them and add the smaller one to the merged list
    while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:
        if left[0] < right[0]:
            merged.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            merged.append(right.pop(0))

    # Add any remaining elements from either list
    merged.extend(left)
    merged.extend(right)

    return merged

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", arr)
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)

# Test the function with a small list
small_list = [3, 2, 1, 4]
print("Small list:", small_list)
small_sorted_list = merge_sort(small_list)
print("Sorted small list:", small_sorted_list)
