# Stack and Queue Operations in Python
=====================================

This script teaches you how to implement basic stack and queue operations using two linked lists. Understanding these data structures is essential for many algorithms and problem-solving tasks.

## Stack Operations

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning the last element added will be the first one to be removed. Python's list type already supports stacks, but we'll implement it manually using a linked list for educational purposes.
